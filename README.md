# Ircbot

**Just another stupid IRC-Bot**
This is a crappy IRC-Bot based on [ExIrc](https://github.com/bitwalker/exirc)
with no tests for failures. It may kills your cat. But it will be killed highly
concurrent. 'Nuff said.

## TODO
* RMV-Checks for next bus [!buba]
* Telegram-to-IRC-Gateway
* Ridiculous replies to random messages
